        <p>I was born and raised in Western New York, in a suburb outside of Buffalo.  All the while growing up, I was crazy
            about sports, especially football, and like every other young boy, wanted to grow up to be a professional athlete. 
              However, I was also pretty nerdy, and very much interested in science and technology, and superheroes(whom I lost 
            interest in when it became cool--true nerd!).  It was those interests that had me looking ahead to the future with
            some backup careers in mind. Those ideal careers included being a cartoonist, being a videogame developer, 
            or some other variety of computer programmer.
            <br><br> 
            
            As a young kid, I was always busy doing something.  Constantly drawing or making pixel art.  Playing piano or composing
            music.  I was taking apart every dispensable electronics device I could find, harvesting its parts, and making my own creations.  I was 
            building simple circuits with resistors, transistors, and capacitors at the age of 7.  I was dreaming of moving to
            Cambridge, MA one day to go on to college at MIT, and become a master of tech.  Or who knew--maybe go on to be a great pianist,
            or professional athlete instead?  After such a productive childhood, as it would turn out, I would go on to do none of those things...
            <br><br>

            It was time for higher education!  I had taken the two computer programming classes that were offered in high school, the former
            of which was easy enough to be an unequivocally happy experience, and 
            the latter of which provided a pretty awful taste in one's mouth (I think the whole cohort would agree).  Being pretty deterred by that class,
            from going into a related field, I pursued my other interests at the time, which were exercise science and anthropology.  I very much 
            enjoyed both, but would commit to the major of exercise science, and afterwards go on to earn my Doctorate of Physical Therapy.
            <br><br>

            I was pretty happy as a licensed physical therapist for 4 years.  Helping people, and problem solving for them to improve their
            quality of life is a very rewarding experience.  However, when you're a creative type who is galvanized by creation, 
            art, design, and entrepreneurship, you have to get that kind of fulfillment from somewhere else.
            <br><br>

            From 2015 to 2020, while in grad school and afterwards, I was the frontman of one band or another.  While I prided myself for
            my compositions and my musical abilities, I wasn't a good MC.  In other words, I was a pretty awkward performer between 
            the musical numbers, and didn't do a great job keeping the momentum and the energy rolling.  Further more, between this endeavor,
            and being a PT, it was getting to be pretty draining, and time-consuming.  It made me long for an opportunity to be able to do
            something creative for my career, where my time, energy and passion could be consolidated.  
            <br><br>

            It was just March of 2020 when both my musicianship, and my job as a PT would be pulled out from underneath me, as a result
            of the covid-19 pandemic. My company announced a company-wide layoff of its therapists.  A shelter-in-place order was implemented,
            making live in-person gigging, as a musician, impossible. I was now unemployed, and my creative outlet felt paralyzed. 
             It was a tough time accompanied by some deflating experiences for me--as it was for many people.  But I took 
            advantage of the free time I had been given, being unemployed, and invested it into self-discovery. 
            <br><br>

            I had nothing to do, and all the time in the world.  It was just like it would have been when I was a child on summer vacation.  
             I was unemployed... but I was lucky, really.  I was being given a second chance to follow my impulses.  A chance to do with my time, whatever
            I was naturally driven towards.  For whatever reason, I was compelled to download and install an Integrated Development Environment.
             Before long, I was utilizing the concepts I remembered from high school, and developing simple blocks of software. 
            <br><br>

            I was starting to feel like that kid I used to be.  Only this time, I had an IDE as a more sophisticated substitute for the screwdriver 
             I would have used to dismantle (with fervor) some poor, unsuspecting, and obsolete electronics device.  
            <br><br>

            I was using tutorials on the internet to further my skills and understanding, but I wanted to accelerate.  I enrolled in a free
            online software course offered by Harvard, called CS50.  After the completion of that, I worked on a pet project a bit, and then
            enrolled in the coding bootcamp, devCodeCamp, of which I am currently enrolled and progressing through.  
            <br><br>

            Now here I am writing and designing the content for this website.  I have a very long way to go before I can become something of a 
            "master of tech", but I learn so many new things every day, and I've never been more happy with what I'm doing, applying creativity,
            and science simultaneously.  All sides of my brain are stimulated and feeling included.  
            <br><br>

            Hey, I may not have gotten to go to MIT, but I live in Boston now, and I got to have the poor man's taster of Harvard.  I may not have become a professional 
            football player, but I was recruited to a semi-pro roster while playing flag football (waiting for the pandemic to end to 
            start playing).  I'm not a pro game developer or cartoonist, but I'm on my way to becoming a programmer of some sort, with the help of devCodeCamp!
             I am genuinely happy and appreciative to be able to reflect, and say, "I am living out the off-brand version of my childhood dreams".
            It really actually is... pretty fantastic.
