        <h3>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am Gregory Ryan, the owner of the Github user profile, GRy82, and the developer of GRy-Dev software projects.  
            Software development started out as a hobby--of which I have many--but it quickly evolved into something more 
            than that for me. Perhaps this is because of the way it can bring in the skill sets and talents from so many
            different things, and perhaps it's because it can, in turn, provide utility for so many different things.

        <h3>Projects</h2>
        <p>Projects on this website include those contained within the repositories of this Github profile--which are mostly
            assigned projects from the coding bootcamp, devCodeCamp.  There are also some independently conceived projects,
            as well a preview and download for my independently created computer game, Pool Ball. Click <a href="">here</a>.
